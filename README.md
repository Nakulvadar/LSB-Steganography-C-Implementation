# LSB-Steganography-C-Implementation
A C-based implementation of LSB (Least Significant Bit) image steganography that hides secret data inside 24-bit BMP files. Includes both encoding and decoding features with modular source files, efficient bit-level operations, and file validation for secure and reliable data hiding.
